     Paarthurnax is a dragon that lives on the Throat of the World, near High Hrothgar. He is the leader of the Greybeards. However, he has a very complicated history.</p>
     <p id="tribute-info">
     Paarthurnax once served as a lieutenant to Alduin. Alduin atttempted to kill all humans and to declare himself the God of everything. Paarthurnax would later realize the error of his ways, and he came to live a peaceful and meditative lifestyle amongst the Greybeards on the Throat of the World.
